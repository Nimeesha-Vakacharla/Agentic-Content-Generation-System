HERE’S THE PRE-FETCHED TRANSCRIPT: AI AND AUTOMATION HAVE ARRIVED AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRANSFORM SOCIETY FOREVER FROM CASHIERS TO CEOS MORE JOBS ARE GETTING REPLACED BY THE MACHINES EVERY DAY THE RISE OF NEW AI MODELS IS PUT ON THE ACCELERATOR PLACING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF JOBS AT RISK BUT AS THE WORLD BECOMES MORE ROBOTIC MORE TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED WHAT PLACE WILL THERE BE FOR HUMANS JUST HOW MANY OF US WILL LOSE OUR JOBS AND IF SO WHO WILL BUY ANYTHING HOW WILL THE ECONOMY EVEN WORK WELL TODAY IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HUMANITY IN THE NEW AGE AND HOW THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO FUNCTION IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY NOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR THAT SOME NEW THING THAT EVERYONE IS PREDICTING WILL COMPLETELY TAKE OVER THE FUTURE MOST OF THEM GET OVERHYPED AND THEY END UP VISITING OUT OR IT TAKES DECADES TO SEE ANY REAL CHANGES AI AND AUTOMATION ARE DIFFERENT AS WE'LL SEE THEY'RE ALREADY CHANGING SOCIETY IN A MASSIVE WAY THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING TONS OF DIFFERENT JOBS AND INDUSTRIES ARE EITHER ABOUT TO CHANGE FOREVER OR THEY ALREADY HAVE WE MENTIONED CASHERS EARLIER AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE JOBS AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF AUTOMATION AND MOST CHANGED JOBS IN SUPER MARKETS IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND WE ALL SEE IT TODAY IT'S VERY RARE TO GO TO ANY STORE NOW WITHOUT ANY SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEM IT JUST SEEMS OUTDATED 2023 WAS ACTUALLY A RECORD YEAR FOR THESE MACHINES WITH OVER 200,000 NEW ONES ADDED TO THE SHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD AND THERE HAVE BEEN MIX FEELINGS ABOUT THEM EVER SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED BUT MOST PEOPLE AT LEAST TOLERATE THEM IN A 2021 SURVEY 60% OF PEOPLE SAID THEY PREFER THEM TO THE REGULAR CHECKOUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE FASTER THAN OTHER METHODS MORE EFFICIENT AND IF YOU IN YOUR OWN HEAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE EVEN IF ALL OF THIS IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OVER AN INCREDIBLY SLOW SYSTEM PEOPLE DO PREFER IT ESPECIALLY THE CORPORATIONS USING THEM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY SAVE IS ASTRONOMICAL WHAT USED TO TAKE PAYING 20 PEOPLE CAN NOW BE DONE WITH 20 MACHINES AND ONLY TWO EMPLOYEES TO OVERSEE THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY LOSE TONS OF STOCK TO THEFT WHICH IS VERY COMMON WITH THE MACHINES AS THEY STILL EASILY PAY FOR THEMSELVES OVER TIME IT ALSO DOESN'T MATTER IF THE WHOLE THING DOES END UP BEING A LOT MORE ANNOYING FOR THE CONSUMER THE PROCESS HASN'T BEEN FULLY AUTOMATED REALLY THE MACHINES ONLY TAKE SOME OF THE LOAD LEAVING THE REST OF IT UP TO YOU MEANING CORPORATIONS MAKE YOU DO THE WORK AND CUT OUT THE COST WHILE ALSO MAKING A PROFIT FROM IT AND THIS SMALL EXAMPLE IS A GLIMPSE INTO A FUTURE OF AUTOMATION ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE PROCESS GETTING AUTOMATED PEOPLE'S JOBS WILL GET REPLACED PARTLY BY MACHINES AND PARTLY BY PASSING THE WORK ONTO THE CONSUMERS INSTEAD IT'S SOMETHING YOU SEE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY OF JOBS THAT'S ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YEARS AND YEARS AGO IF YOU CALLED A COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE TALKING TO ANOTHER PERSON WHO COULD UNDERSTAND YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT NOW AUTOMATION IS MADE IT SO YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF MACHINES BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN IN THE QUEUE AND THAT'S IF THE BOT ON THE OTHER END CAN EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NER FOR EVERYONE AND IT CLEARLY DOESN'T MATTER IF THE SERVICE GETS BETTER AS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER IT MAKES A PROFIT AI MIGHT MAKE THESE PROBLEMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT IT WILL ALSO REPLACE LOTS OF THE THINGS THEY STILL NEED REAL PEOPLE FOR AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING TAKE THE INDIAN E-COMMERCE COMPANY DUAN WHICH WAS WORTH $70 MILLION IN THE LAST EVALUATION AND IN 2023 THEIR CEO TOOK TO TWITTER TO BRAG ABOUT HOW HE'D BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE 9 0% OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF WITH AN AI PROGRAM REDUCING THE COMPANY'S COST BY 85% YOU CAN FEEL THE JOY OOZING OUT OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE CAN FIRE 90% OF ONE OF HIS DEPARTMENTS WHILE OTHER CEOS MIGHT HIDE IT A BIT BETTER THEY'RE STILL SALIVATING OF THE POSSIBILITIES AS WELL THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH WILL SOON HAPPEN TO THE ENTIRE CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY EVENTUALLY EVEN REPRESENTATIVES AND PHYSICAL STORES COULD GET REPLACED BY A TOUCHSCREEN AND A CHAT BOT IT'S YET ANOTHER WHOLE CATEGORY OF JOBS THAT WILL SOON JUST DISAPPEAR UNDER THE STEAMROLLER OF AUTOMATION AND A I DATA ENTRY JOBS ARE GOING THE SAME WAY TOO BETWEEN 2014 AND 2022 THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WORKING THESE JOBS IN THE US FELL BY OVER 20% FROM 375,000 TO 295,000 IT'S ALREADY A DYING INDUSTRY ADVANCES IN AI WILL PUSH THIS OVER THE EDGE THE MORE PROCEDURAL AND CONSISTENT THE WORK IS THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT A COMPUTER CAN DO IT INSTEAD TO GO A BIT FURTHER ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER OFFICE JOBS ARE ALSO DESTINED TO BE REPLACED THIS CATEGORY ENCOMPASSES MILLIONS OF JOBS LOTS OF THEM COULD EASILY VANISH IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS SOME WILL SURVIVE OF COURSE IF YOU NEED SPECIALIST SKILLS OR YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IT'S MUCH HARDER TO AUTOMATE BUT THE ONES LOWER DOWN ON THE LADDER WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY GO WHICH WILL JUST MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET AN ENTRY-LEVEL JOB A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES IN IT CREATES MORE JOBS THAN IT REPLACES WHEN WE STARTED USING CARS INSTEAD OF HORSES FOR TRANSPORTATION IT DIDN'T UPEND THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THERE WERE NEW ROLES FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEFORE THAT BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH AI WILL THE SAME THING BE THE CASE WELL IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED WITH AI AND IT ISN'T A BLACK AND WHITE PCTURE PICTURE ONE OF MY FAVORITE TV SHOWS IS MR ROBOT AND YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL FROM THE CHANNEL BUT DID YOU SEE THE MAIL SERVICE THEY USE IN THE SHOW WELL THEY'RE ACTUALLY TODAY'S VIDEO SPONSOR PROTONVPN THE VPN

UNRESTRICTED SECURE AND FAST INTERNET ACCESS NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE CHECK THEM OUT TODAY USING MY LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW AND FOR NEW USERS IF YOU USE THE LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW YOU'LL GET 55% OFF USING MY LINK NOW WE'VE SEEN HOW NEW GENERATIVE AI MODELS LIKE CHBT ARE ALMOST PERFECTLY SUITED TO BASIC CODING GET THEM A SINGLE PROMPT AND THEY'LL DO HOURS OF WORK WITHIN SECONDS WITH A BIT OF EDITING BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IT'S FIT FOR PURPOSE JUST LIKE THE SELF CHECKER MACHINES IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF THE COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT ONE SKILL CODER COULD USE ADVANCED AI TO DO THE WORK OF FIVE OF 10 PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW TO THE FIELD IT MEANS THAT EVEN IF AI CAN'T DO 100% OF THE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB IT RAISES THE BAR EXPONENTIALLY AS TO WHAT THE STANDARD IS IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH CAN IN TURN REPLACE TONS OF PEOPLE A LOT OF THESE JOBS AREN'T THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY BE SPENDING THEIR WHOLE LIVES ON ANYWAY THOUGH BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE A CASHIER OR WORK IN DATA ENTRY WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP IN A 50 OR 100 YEARS TIME WHEN THE DUST IS SETTLED THE WORLD MAY ACTUALLY BE THANKFUL THAT WE'VE ESCAPED FROM ALL THIS MINIAL LABOR BUT UNTIL THAT POINT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERGO SOME HUGE CHANGES AND THE MAIN QUESTION WILL BE WHO WILL BE BUYING ANYTHING IF NOBODY'S REALLY WORKING ANYMORE AS WE MAY VERY WELL BE IN A WORLD WHERE NOT EVERYONE IS EXPECTED OR NEEDED TO EVEN HAVE A JOB SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM TO GO AROUND SO WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PREDICTIONS FOR HOW BAD THE DAMAGE IS REALLY GOING TO BE WELL THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES BUT EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE STILL MEAN THAT MILLIONS OF JOBS WILL GET REPLACED IN THE SHORT TERM IT ISN'T LOOKING GOOD IT'S GENERALLY AGREED THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF JOBS WILL BE LOST OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO AI A LOT MORE WILL BE IMPACTED IN SOME WAY WHICH MEANS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD WORK WILL GET AUTOMATED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE JOBS IT MEANS EMPLOYEES WOULD ONLY DEAL WITH THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS THAT AN AI CAN'T SOLVE EVEN THOUGH MOST PREDICTIONS THINK IT WILL BOOST THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE REPLACED THEN HOW WILL THE ECONOMY GO UP SO MUCH IF NO ONE CAN BUY ANYTHING WELL THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING AS WE'VE SEEN ALREADY WITH AUTOMATION WHEN THE JOB GETS EASIER THERE'S FAR MORE COMPETITION BEFORE GPS WAS WIDELY USED BEING A LONDON TAXI DRIVER WAS AN INCREDIBLY HARD JOB IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT YOU NEEDED TO MEMOR A COMPLETE STREET MAP OF THE CITY GPS AND RIDE SHARING APPS TORE THROUGH THIS BARRIER MEANING ANYONE WITH A CAR AND A PHONE COULD ADEQUATELY DO THE JOB AND THE RESULTS WERE CLEAR LONDON TAXI DRIVERS SAW THEIR WAGES FALL BY 10% AND IT SEEMS LIKE AI MIGHT DO THIS EXACT SAME THING TO NEARLY EVERY JOB THERE IS 60% OF THEM IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE PARTS THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED WILL BE TAKEN OVER LEAVING EITHER LESS JOBS OR LOWER WAGES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN STILL CLING ON THE PAPERWORK THAT MAKES UP TONS OF THE WORKLOAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE DOCTORS OR POLICE OFFICERS WILL DISAPPEAR MEANING THERE'S LESS WORK OVERALL ONLY A FEW INDUSTRIES LIKE TEACHING OR AGRICULTURE ARE GOING TO ESCAPE SOME LEVEL OF AUTOMATION WHICH AGAIN BRINGS UP THE SAME MASSIVE QUESTION HOW WILL THE ECONOMY THEN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WITH SO MANY PEOPLE EITHER OUT OF WORK OR STRUGGLING TO MAKE END ME IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD HAVE BEEN TAKING RECORD PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE AND SO IT DOESN'T SEEM REALISTIC TO IMAGINE THAT THEY'RE SUDDENLY GOING TO SHARE THE MONEY THEY'LL MAKE FROM THE AI REVOLUTION IT'S CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY WORK PHYSICAL LABOR WILL STILL BE IMPORTANT BUT IT WON'T BE IS COMMON BASIC OFFICE WORK AND SIMPLE COGNITIVE TASKS ARE GOING TO BE FAR LESS IMPORTANT IT'S WHAT AI DOES BEST MEANWHILE COMPLICATED TASKS WHICH NEED A LOT OF TRAINING OR A GOOD DEAL OF NATURAL ABILITY WILL BE IN MUCH HIGHER DEMAND WE'VE SEEN FROM HISTORY THAT THESE KINDS OF SHIFTS LEAD TO STAGNANT WAGES AFTER THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN THE 19TH CENTURY WHEN MILLIONS MOVED FROM AGRICULTURE TO MANUFACTURING WAGES STAYED AT AROUND THE SAME LEVEL FOR 50 YEARS STRAIGHT IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN THEN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP WE SEE TODAY COULD CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 30 TO 40 YEARS BEFORE IT CORRECTS ITSELF IN FACT THIS TIME IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORSE IT'S A SIMPLE TRUTH THAT TONS OF PEOPLE JUST AREN'T ACADEMICALLY SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TRANSITION IT'S A PIPE DREAM TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN THE MILLIONS OF TRUCK DRIVERS THAT WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS TO DO SOMETHING ELSE THE JOBS THEY COULD REALISTICALLY WORK INSTEAD ARE DISAPPEARING PEOPLE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS CAN'T REALLY EASILY RETRAIN IN ANOTHER FIELD AND OFTEN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BEST OF CASES THEY GO INTO DISABILITY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES OFTEN THEY JUST CAN'T COPE WITH LOSING THEIR PURPOSE TURNING TO DRINK OR DRUGS OR SIMPLY JUST GIVING UP IT'S AWFUL TRAGEDY THAT'S GOING TO BE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF WE CAN'T FIND A SOLUTION AND THIS TRANSITION WILL LEAVE TONS OF PEOPLE BEHIND AS MOST OF US JUST DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS OR THE NATURAL ABILITY TO WORK THE HIGHLY COMPLICATED ACADEMIC JOBS THAT AI WILL CREATE THE AI TRUCKS WILL NEED PEOPLE TO OVERSEE THE OPERATION AND MAKE SURE IT'S ALL RUNNING SMOOTHLY EVEN DIRECTLY TAKING CONTROL OF CERTAIN TRUCKS IF NECESSARY BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE EASY FOR ANYONE TO PICK UP WITHOUT SPECIFIC TRAINING THE WORLD IS JUST GETTING TOO COMPLICATED FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT THIS COULD BE ONE AREA WHERE PEOPLE COULD STILL FIND A NICHE INSTEAD INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY WORKING AS A CASHIER SHOP ASSISTANTS NOW OFTEN OVERSEE A GROUP OF SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES INSTEAD OF THE JOB GETTING HARDER IT CHANGED THAT MOST OF THE WORK IS GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS INSTEAD AS MORE AND MORE OF THE WORLD GETS AUTOMATED WE'LL NEED TONS OF PEOPLE TO START WORKING THESE JOBS IN OTHER FIELDS GRANDMA IS NOT GOING TO BE MAGICALLY FIGURING ALL OF THIS OUT HERSELF SHE'S GOING TO NEED SOME HELP BECAUSE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES ARE MOSTLY MADE UP OF SERVICE JOBS THIS IS GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S A NICHE THAT PEOPLE WITH MORE HUMAN- CENTERED SKILLS ARE GOING TO THRIVE IN AND IT COULD BE A GOOD WAY TO TRANSITION PEOPLE THAT AREN'T GOING TO RETRAIN AS CODERS OR COMPLEX SYSTEM MANAGERS THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVEN IF ENOUGH OF THESE JOBS GET CREATED WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY THEY OFTEN PAY WAY LESS IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO SEE WAY LESS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF NORMAL PEOPLE IN GENERAL BUT AGAIN THEN HOW WILL THE ECONOMY CONTINUE TO FUNCTION HOW CAN PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP AND AN ECONOMY START BOOMING IF NOBODY HAS ANY MONEY TO ACTUALLY SPEND WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO MAIN WAYS THIS CAN ALL PLAY OUT THE FIRST OPTION COULD JUST BE COMPLETE DISASTER SOCIETY CONTINUES ON NO CHECKS ARE IN PLACE BIG TECH AI COMPANIES GET OUT OF CONTROL ETHICS DEPARTMENTS ARE CONTINUALLY STRIPPED AND LACKING GOVERNMENT REGULATION MEANS WE ENTER INTO A TECHNOCRACY COMPANIES WILL PRETEND IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT OVER TIME THEY'LL CUT OUT MORE AND MORE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOMEONE TO DEAL WITH LATER ON IF USING AI MAKES A COMPANY 20% MORE PRODUCTIVE THEN THEY CAN FIRE 20% OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MAINTAIN THE SAME OUTPUTS PEOPLE WON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S AI EITHER THEY'LL JUST GET FIRED FOR QUOTE UNDERPERFORMING INSTEAD ON THIS PATH WE'LL SEE AN OUTCRY OF BIG CHANGES LIKE SELF-DRIVING TRUCKS BUT THE SMALL CHANGES THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER WILL GO UNNOTICED THE MEDIA WILL BLAME THE SAME TD OLD ISSUES WHILE MORE PEOPLE GET PUSHED OUT OF THE SYSTEM EVERY DAY IN THIS FUTURE THE PROFITS FROM AI WON'T GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS WILL BE PARALYZED BY LOBBYISTS MAKING SURE THE CORPORATIONS ARE KEEPING THEIR PROFITS IN CHECK MEANWHILE THEY'LL GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO DEAL WITH MILLIONS OF NEWLY UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WITHOUT THOSE JOBS PEOPLE SIMPLY WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING CRIME WILL SKYROCKET AS PEOPLE GO INTO DESPERATION TAXES WILL BARELY BE PAID POLICE OFFICE IS STRIPPED AWAY FROM THE STREETS AND ANARCHY AND LAWLESSNESS TAKES OVER SOCIETY THE RELATIVE VALUE OF HUMAN LABOR PLUMMETS MEANING ALMOST EVERYBODY SHUT OUT OF THE ECONOMY WITHOUT ANYTHING TO KEEP THEMSELVES AFLOAT APART FROM STEALING FROM ONE ANOTHER FENDING FOR THEMSELVES AND SING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SURVIVE WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE RECIPE FOR CHAOS PEOPLE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO GAIN SO THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE THEY'LL VOTE FOR WHOEVER SAYS THEY'LL MAKE THINGS BETTER THE PEOPLE OFFERING THE SIMPLEST SOLUTIONS IT MEANS A RISE IN EXTREMISM THAT WILL LEAD TO UNREST AND EVENTUALLY REVOLUTIONS AND EVEN DICTATORSHIP AND FASCISM OR IF IT'S WINGS THE OTHER WAY AROUND COMMUNISM NOW IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THAT'S FAR AWAY BUT ALL IT TAKES IS ENOUGH HUNGRY PEOPLE TO UPEND THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SUDDENLY THE REALITY THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO EXIST KEY GOVERNMENT SERVICES LIKE POLICING AMBULANCES LAW AND ORDER WILL JUST BE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT HAVE NO RELEVANCY AND EVENTUALLY THE ECONOMIC SCALES WILL TI BACK THE OTHER WAY JUST LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE BUT IT WOULD TAKE DECADES AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW MANY CASUALTIES THERE WILL BE ALONG THE WAY AND OF COURSE NONE OF THIS IS SET IN STONE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS GLOBAL TRAGEDY BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO HINGE ON WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY AND THE VALUE THAT AI IS GOING TO CREATE IF IT GETS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT IT WILL SOFTEN THE BLOW SIGNIFICANTLY THERE AREN'T ANY EASY SOLUTIONS BUT THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT COULD REALLY HELP TAKE THE EDGE OF THIS CRISIS ONE SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALTHOUGH NOT NEARLY ENOUGH COULD BE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OTHERWISE KNOWN AS UBI USING THE PROFITS FROM AI AND INCREDIBLY WELL-MAINTAINED AUTOMATED SYSTEMS WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO MAKE TRILLIONS IN PROFITS DEVELOPED GOVERNMENTS COULD SIMPLY GIVE THEIR CITIZENS ENOUGH MONEY TO NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WORKING BUT ALSO KEEP SOCIETY IN CHECK AND TAX IS PAID HOWEVER IT'S NOT JUST AS SIMPLE AS THIS THE LOSS OF MEANING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IS THEY HAVE NO PASSION NO ACTUAL WORK TO DO NO CAREER NO DESTINY WILL MAY PEOPLE FEEL APATHETIC AND JUST LAZY AN ESSENTIAL PART OF BEING A HUMAN IS WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING WHICH CAN'T JUST BE REPLACED BY A MONTHLY CHECK HANDED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT IT'D BE MORE LIKE A BAND-AID THAN AN ACTUAL CURE BUT IT WOULD AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO HUNGRY AND AI WOULDN'T COMPLETELY DESTROY THEIR LIVES]: 2025-03-16

Here’s the pre-fetched transcript: Ai and automation have arrived and they're going to transform Society forever from cashiers to CEOs more jobs are getting replaced by the machines every day the rise of new AI models is put on the accelerator placing hundreds of millions of jobs at risk but as the world becomes more robotic more technology focused what place will there be for humans just how many of us will lose our jobs and if so who will buy anything how will the economy even work well today in this video we're going to find out what's going to happen to humanity in the new age and how the economy is going to function in a completely different way now it seems like every year that some new thing that everyone is predicting will completely take over the future most of them get overhyped and they end up visiting out or it takes decades to see any real changes Ai and automation are different as we'll see they're already changing Society in a massive way this is just the beginning tons of different jobs and industries are either about to change forever or they already have we mentioned Cashers earlier and they're one of the jobs at the highest risk of Automation and most changed jobs in super markets it's already happened and we all see it today it's very rare to go to any store now without any self checkout machines and if they don't have them it just seems outdated 2023 was actually a record year for these machines with over 200,000 new ones added to the shops across the world and there have been mix feelings about them ever since they were introduced but most people at least tolerate them in a 2021 survey 60% of people said they prefer them to the regular checkout most of the time they're faster than other methods more efficient and if you in your own head you don't have to speak to anyone even if all of this is just a minor improvement over an incredibly slow system people do prefer it especially the corporations using them the amount of money they save is astronomical what used to take paying 20 people can now be done with 20 machines and only two employees to oversee them it doesn't matter if they lose tons of stock to theft which is very common with the machines as they still easily pay for themselves over time it also doesn't matter if the whole thing does end up being a lot more annoying for the consumer the process hasn't been fully automated really the machines only take some of the load leaving the rest of it up to you meaning corporations make you do the work and cut out the cost while also making a profit from it and this small example is a glimpse into a future of automation on a much larger scale instead of the whole process getting automated people's jobs will get replaced partly by machines and partly by passing the work onto the consumers instead it's something you see in another category of jobs that's about to disappear customer service years and years ago if you called a company's customer service line you would immediately be talking to another person who could understand your very specific question but now automation is made it so you need to go through five different layers of machines before you're even in the queue and that's if the bot on the other end can even understand what you're saying it's an absolute ner for everyone and it clearly doesn't matter if the service gets better as the only thing that matters is whether it makes a profit AI might make these problems a little bit better but it will also replace lots of the things they still need real people for and it's already happening take the Indian e-commerce company Duan which was worth $70 million in the last evaluation and in 2023 their CEO took to Twitter to brag about how he'd been able to replace 9 0% of the customer service staff with an AI program reducing the company's cost by 85% you can feel the joy oozing out of his announcement that he can fire 90% of one of his departments while other CEOs might hide it a bit better they're still salivating of the possibilities as well this is something which will soon happen to the entire customer service industry eventually even representatives and physical stores could get replaced by a touchscreen and a chat bot it's yet another whole category of jobs that will soon just disappear under the steamroller of Automation and a i data entry jobs are going the same way too between 2014 and 2022 the amount of people working these jobs in the US fell by over 20% from 375,000 to 295,000 it's already a dying industry advances in AI will push this over the edge the more procedural and consistent the work is the more likely it is that a computer can do it instead to go a bit further Administration and other office jobs are also destined to be replaced this category encompasses millions of jobs lots of them could easily vanish in the next 10 years some will survive of course if you need specialist skills or you need to deal with lots of different problems it's much harder to automate but the ones lower down on the ladder will almost certainly go which will just make it harder for young people to get an entry-level job a lot of the time when new technology comes in it creates more jobs than it replaces when we started using cars instead of horses for transportation it didn't upend the economy because there were new roles for people to take it was the same with the Industrial Revolution before that but what will happen with AI will the same thing be the case well it's a lot more complicated with AI and it isn't a black and white pcture picture one of my favorite TV shows is Mr Robot and you can probably tell from the channel but did you see the mail service they use in the show well they're actually today's video sponsor protonvpn the VPN service that's taking the World by storm with its massive Global Network with over 6,500 servers in more than 110 countries protonvpn has the most extensive coverage available making it the go-to

protonvpn is a musthave whether you're an activist a journalist or someone who just wants to browse privately proton VPN helps protect what's yours it's one of the few tools out there that truly fights back against big Tech and protects your personal information but as you can see in Mr Robot proton is way more than just proton VPN proton also has a whole bundle for you to degoogle your life from mail pass manager proton docs and drive and it doesn't stop there proton vpm also comes with an integrated ad blocker that's completely open source and uses Only the strongest most secure protocols like wire guard and openvpn the app's code is completely open source and publicly available for inspection online they've also commissioned independent Security Experts to AIT all of their apps you can actually read their analysis on their website but it should be clear that proton will never share or sell your information with third parties so why wait get protonvpn today and enjoy unrestricted secure and fast internet access no matter where you are check them out today using my link in the description below and for new users if you use the link in the description below you'll get 55% off using my link now we've seen how new generative AI models like chbt are almost perfectly suited to basic coding get them a single prompt and they'll do hours of work within seconds with a bit of editing by someone who knows what they're doing it's fit for purpose just like the self Checker machines it isn't a question of the complete replacement of people it's just that one skill coder could use Advanced AI to do the work of five of 10 people who are new to the field it means that even if AI can't do 100% of the tasks associated with the job it raises the bar exponentially as to what the standard is in the industry which can in turn replace tons of people a lot of these jobs aren't things people should really be spending their whole lives on anyway though because nobody really wants to be a cashier or work in data entry when they're growing up in a 50 or 100 years time when the dust is settled the world may actually be thankful that we've escaped from all this minial labor but until that point the economy is going to have to undergo some huge changes and the main question will be who will be buying anything if nobody's really working anymore as we may very well be in a world where not everyone is expected or needed to even have a job simply because there just aren't enough of them to go around so what are the various predictions for how bad the damage is really going to be well there's lots of different estimates but even the most conservative still mean that millions of jobs will get replaced in the short term it isn't looking good it's generally agreed that tens of millions of jobs will be lost over the next decade to AI a lot more will be impacted in some way which means that some parts of the world work will get automated for customer service jobs it means employees would only deal with the complicated problems that an AI can't solve even though most predictions think it will boost the global economy by trillions of dollars so how does this make sense if people are actually going to be replaced then how will the economy go up so much if no one can buy anything well this is where it gets interesting as we've seen already with automation when the job gets easier there's far more competition before GPS was widely used being a London taxi driver was an incredibly hard job if you wanted to do it you needed to memor a complete street map of the city GPS and ride sharing apps tore through this barrier meaning anyone with a car and a phone could adequately do the job and the results were clear London taxi drivers saw their wages Fall by 10% and it seems like AI might do this exact same thing to nearly every job there is 60% of them in developed countries the parts that can be automated will be taken over leaving either Less jobs or lower wages for the people who can still cling on the paperwork that makes up tons of the workload for people like doctors or police officers will disappear meaning there's less work overall only a few Industries like teaching or agriculture are going to escape some level of automation which again brings up the same massive question how will the economy then continue to function with so many people either out of work or struggling to make end me it isn't clear how we're going to solve this corporations across the board have been taking record profits at the expense of almost everyone else and so it doesn't seem realistic to imagine that they're suddenly going to share the money they'll make from the AI Revolution it's clear at this point that people are going to need to change the way they work physical labor will still be important but it won't be is common basic office work and simple cognitive tasks are going to be far less important it's what AI does best meanwhile complicated tasks which need a lot of training or a good deal of natural ability will be in much higher demand we've seen from history that these kinds of shifts lead to stagnant wages after the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century when Millions moved from agriculture to manufacturing wages stayed at around the same level for 50 years straight if this happens again then the economic hardship we see today could continue for another 30 to 40 years before it corrects itself in fact this time it might even be worse it's a simple truth that tons of people just aren't academically smart enough to make the transition it's a pipe dream to imagine that we're going to train the millions of truck drivers that will lose their jobs to do something else the jobs they could realistically work instead are disappearing people without college degrees that lose their jobs can't really easily retrain in another field and often fall through the cracks in the best of cases they go into disability for the rest of their lives often they just can't cope with losing their purpose turning to drink or drugs or simply just giving up it's awful tragedy that's going to be repeated over and over again if we can't find a solution and this transition will leave tons of people behind as most of us just don't have the skills or the natural ability to work the highly complicated academic jobs that AI will create the AI trucks will need people to oversee the operation and make sure it's all running smoothly even directly taking control of certain trucks if necessary but it's not something that's going to be easy for anyone to pick up without specific training the world is just getting too complicated for most people but this could be one area where people could still find a niche instead instead of directly working as a cashier shop assistants now often oversee a group of self checkout machines instead of the job getting harder it changed that most of the work is guiding people through the process instead as more and more of the world gets automated we'll need tons of people to start working these jobs in other fields grandma is not going to be magically figuring all of this out herself she's going to need some help because developed economies are mostly made up of service jobs this is going to create more jobs than you might think it's a niche that people with more human- centered skills are going to thrive in and it could be a good way to transition people that aren't going to retrain as coders or complex system managers the problem is that even if enough of these jobs get created which seems unlikely they often pay way less in fact we're going to see way less money in the hands of normal people in general but again then how will the economy continue to function how can prices continue to go up and an economy start booming if nobody has any money to actually spend we're at a crossroads right now there's two main ways this can all play out the first option could just be complete disaster Society continues on no checks are in place big Tech AI companies get out of control ethics departments are continually stripped and lacking government regulation means we enter into a technocracy companies will pretend it's business as usual but over time they'll cut out more and more of their employees leaving the consequences for someone to deal with later on if using AI makes a company 20% more productive then they can fire 20% of their employees and maintain the same outputs people won't even know it's AI either they'll just get fired for quote underperforming instead on this path we'll see an outcry of big changes like self-driving trucks but the small changes that make the difference when you put them together will go unnoticed the media will blame the same TD old issues while more people get pushed out of the system every day in this future the profits from AI won't go to the people who need them corrupt governments will be paralyzed by lobbyists making sure the corporations are keeping their profits in check meanwhile they'll go bankrupt trying to deal with millions of newly unemployed people without those jobs people simply won't have enough money to keep the economy going crime will Skyrocket as people go into desperation taxes will barely be paid police office is Stripped Away from the streets and Anarchy and lawlessness takes over Society the relative value of human labor plummets meaning almost everybody shut out of the economy without anything to keep themselves afloat apart from stealing from one another fending for themselves and sing whatever they can to survive which is an absolute recipe for chaos people won't have anything to gain so they won't have anything to lose they'll vote for whoever says they'll make things better the people offering the simplest Solutions it means a rise in extremism that will lead to unrest and eventually revolutions and even dictatorship and fascism or if it's Wings the other way around communism now it might seem like that's far away but all it takes is enough hungry people to upend the entire system suddenly the reality the social norms that we live in today just won't be able to exist key government services like policing ambulances Law and Order will just be abstract Concepts that have no relevancy and eventually the economic scales will TI back the other way just like they always have but it would take decades and it's impossible to say how many casualties there will be along the way and of course none of this is set in stone there is an alternative to This Global tragedy but it's all going to hinge on what happens to the money and the value that AI is going to create if it gets to the people who need it it will soften the blow significantly there aren't any easy solutions but there's a few things that could really help take the edge of this crisis one solution that's been discussed although not nearly enough could be Universal basic income otherwise known as Ubi using the profits from Ai and Incredibly well-maintained automated systems which are projected to make trillions in profits developed governments could simply give their citizens enough money to never have to worry about working but also keep Society in check and tax is paid however it's not just as simple as this the loss of meaning in people's lives is they have no passion no actual work to do no career no Destiny will may people feel apathetic and just lazy an essential part of being a human is working towards something which can't just be replaced by a monthly check handed out by the government it'd be more like a Band-Aid than an actual cure but it would at least make sure that people don't go hungry and AI wouldn't completely destroy their

forever. From cashiers to CEOs, more jobs are getting replaced by the machines every day. The rise of new AI models is put on the accelerator, placing hundreds of millions of jobs at risk. But as the world becomes more robotic, more technology focused, what place will there be for humans? Just how many of us will lose our jobs? And if so, who will buy anything? How will the economy even work? Well, today in this video we're going to find out what's going to happen to humanity in the new age and how the economy is going to function in a completely different way. Now it seems like every year that some new thing that everyone is predicting will completely take over the future. Most of them get overhyped and they end up fizzling out, or it takes decades to see any real changes. AI and automation are different, as we'll see. They're already changing Society in a massive way. This is just the beginning. Tons of different jobs and industries are either about to change forever or they already have. We mentioned cashiers earlier, and they're one of the jobs at the highest risk of automation and most changed jobs in supermarkets. It's already happened and we all see it today. It's very rare to go to any store now without any self-checkout machines, and if they don't have them it just seems outdated. 2023 was actually a record year for these machines, with over 200,000 new ones added to the shops across the world. And there have been mixed feelings about them ever since they were introduced, but most people at least tolerate them. In a 2021 survey, 60% of people said they prefer them to the regular checkout most of the time. They're faster than other methods, more efficient, and if you're in your own head, you don't have to speak to anyone. Even if all of this is just a minor improvement over an incredibly slow system, people do prefer it, especially the corporations using them. The amount of money they save is astronomical. What used to take paying 20 people can now be done with 20 machines and only two employees to oversee them. It doesn't matter if they lose tons of stock to theft, which is very common with the machines, as they still easily pay for themselves over time. It also doesn't matter if the whole thing does end up being a lot more annoying for the consumer. The process hasn't been fully automated, really. The machines only take some of the load, leaving the rest of it up to you, meaning corporations make you do the work and cut out the cost while also making a profit from it. And this small example is a glimpse into a future of automation on a much larger scale. Instead of the whole process getting automated, people's jobs will get replaced partly by machines and partly by passing the work onto the consumers instead. It's something you see in another category of jobs that's about to disappear: customer service. Years and years ago, if you called a company's customer service line, you would immediately be talking to another person who could understand your very specific question. But now automation has made it so you need to go through five different layers of machines before you're even in the queue, and that's if the bot on the other end can even understand what you're saying. It's an absolute nightmare for everyone, and it clearly doesn't matter if the service gets better, as the only thing that matters is whether it makes a profit. AI might make these problems a little bit better, but it will also replace lots of the things they still need real people for, and it's already happening. Take the Indian e-commerce company, Dukaan, which was worth $70 million in the last evaluation, and in 2023 their CEO took to Twitter to brag about how he'd been able to replace 90% of the customer service staff with an AI program, reducing the company's cost by 85%. You can feel the joy oozing out of his announcement that he can fire 90% of one of his departments. While other CEOs might hide it a bit better, they're still salivating at the possibilities as well. This is something which will soon happen to the entire customer service industry. Eventually, even representatives in physical stores could get replaced by a touchscreen and a chatbot. It's yet another whole category of jobs that will soon just disappear under the steamroller of automation and AI. Data entry jobs are going the same way, too. Between 2014 and 2022, the amount of people working these jobs in the US fell by over 20%, from 375,000 to 295,000. It's already a dying industry. Advances in AI will push this over the edge. The more procedural and consistent the work is, the more likely it is that a computer can do it instead. To go a bit further, administration and other office jobs are also destined to be replaced. This category encompasses millions of jobs; lots of them could easily vanish in the next 10 years. Some will survive, of course. If you need specialist skills or you need to deal with lots of different problems, it's much harder to automate, but the ones lower down on the ladder will almost certainly go, which will just make it harder for young people to get an entry-level job. A lot of the time when new technology comes in, it creates more jobs than it replaces. When we started using cars instead of horses for transportation, it didn't upend the economy because there were new roles for people to take. It was the same with the Industrial Revolution before that. But what will happen with AI? Will the same thing be the case? Well, it's a lot more complicated with AI, and it isn't a black and white picture.

Check them out today using my link in the description below, and for new users, if you use the link in the description below, you'll get 55% off. Using my link now, we've seen how new generative AI models like ChatGPT are almost perfectly suited to basic coding. Get them a single prompt and they'll do hours of work within seconds. With a bit of editing by someone who knows what they're doing, it's fit for purpose. Just like the self-checkout machines, it isn't a question of the complete replacement of people. It's just that one skilled coder could use advanced AI to do the work of five or 10 people who are new to the field. It means that even if AI can't do 100% of the tasks associated with the job, it raises the bar exponentially as to what the standard is in the industry, which can in turn replace tons of people. A lot of these jobs aren't things people should really be spending their whole lives on anyway, though, because nobody really wants to be a cashier or work in data entry when they're growing up. In 50 or 100 years' time, when the dust is settled, the world may actually be thankful that we've escaped from all this menial labor. But until that point, the economy is going to have to undergo some huge changes, and the main question will be: who will be buying anything if nobody's really working anymore? As we may very well be in a world where not everyone is expected or needed to even have a job, simply because there just aren't enough of them to go around. So what are the various predictions for how bad the damage is really going to be? Well, there's lots of different estimates, but even the most conservative still mean that millions of jobs will get replaced in the short term. It isn't looking good. It's generally agreed that tens of millions of jobs will be lost over the next decade to AI. A lot more will be impacted in some way, which means that some parts of the world's work will get automated. For customer service jobs, it means employees would only deal with the complicated problems that an AI can't solve. Even though most predictions think it will boost the global economy by trillions of dollars, so how does this make sense? If people are actually going to be replaced, then how will the economy go up so much if no one can buy anything? Well, this is where it gets interesting. As we've seen already with automation, when the job gets easier, there's far more competition. Before GPS was widely used, being a London taxi driver was an incredibly hard job. If you wanted to do it, you needed to memorize a complete street map of the city. GPS and ride-sharing apps tore through this barrier, meaning anyone with a car and a phone could adequately do the job, and the results were clear. London taxi drivers saw their wages fall by 10%, and it seems like AI might do this exact same thing to nearly every job there is – 60% of them in developed countries. The parts that can be automated will be taken over, leaving either less jobs or lower wages for the people who can still cling on. The paperwork that makes up tons of the workload for people like doctors or police officers will disappear, meaning there's less work overall. Only a few industries like teaching or agriculture are going to escape some level of automation, which again brings up the same massive question: how will the economy then continue to function with so many people either out of work or struggling to make ends meet? It isn't clear how we're going to solve this. Corporations across the board have been taking record profits at the expense of almost everyone else, and so it doesn't seem realistic to imagine that they're suddenly going to share the money they'll make from the AI revolution. It's clear at this point that people are going to need to change the way they work. Physical labor will still be important, but it won't be as common. Basic office work and simple cognitive tasks are going to be far less important; it's what AI does best. Meanwhile, complicated tasks which need a lot of training or a good deal of natural ability will be in much higher demand. We've seen from history that these kinds of shifts lead to stagnant wages. After the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, when millions moved from agriculture to manufacturing, wages stayed at around the same level for 50 years straight. If this happens again, then the economic hardship we see today could continue for another 30 to 40 years before it corrects itself. In fact, this time it might even be worse. It's a simple truth that tons of people just aren't academically smart enough to make the transition. It's a pipe dream to imagine that we're going to train the millions of truck drivers that will lose their jobs to do something else. The jobs they could realistically work instead are disappearing. People without college degrees that lose their jobs can't really easily retrain in another field and often fall through the cracks. In the best of cases, they go into disability for the rest of their lives. Often they just can't cope with losing their purpose, turning to drink or drugs, or simply just giving up. It's an awful tragedy that's going to be repeated over and over again if we can't find a solution. And this transition will leave tons of people behind, as most of us just don't have the skills or the natural ability to work the highly complicated, academic jobs that AI will create. The AI trucks will need people to oversee the operation and make sure it's all running smoothly, even directly taking control of certain trucks if necessary, but it's not something that's going to be easy for anyone to pick up without specific training. The world is just getting too complicated for most people. But this could be one area where people could still find a niche. Instead of directly working as a cashier, shop assistants now often oversee a group of self-checkout machines. Instead of the job getting harder, it changed; most of the work is guiding people through the process instead. As more and more of the world gets automated, we'll need tons of people to start working these jobs in other fields. Grandma is not going to be magically figuring all of this out herself; she's going to need some help. Because developed economies are mostly made up of service jobs, this is going to create more jobs than you might think. It's a niche that people with more human-centered skills are going to thrive in, and it could be a good way to transition people that aren't going to retrain as coders or complex system managers. The problem is that even if enough of these jobs get created, which seems unlikely, they often pay way less. In fact, we're going to see way less money in the hands of normal people in general. But again, then how will the economy continue to function? How can prices continue to go up and an economy start booming if nobody has any money to actually spend? We're at a crossroads right now. There are two main ways this can all play out. The first option could just be complete disaster. Society continues on; no checks are in place. Big tech, AI companies get out of control; ethics departments are continually stripped and lacking. Government regulation means we enter into a technocracy. Companies will pretend it's business as usual, but over time they'll cut out more and more of their employees, leaving the consequences for someone to deal with later on. If using AI makes a company 20% more productive, then they can fire 20% of their employees and maintain the same outputs. People won't even know it's AI; they'll just get fired for \"underperforming\" instead. On this path, we'll see an outcry of big changes like self-driving trucks, but the small changes that make the difference when you put them together will go unnoticed. The media will blame the same old issues while more people get pushed out of the system every day. In this future, the profits from AI won't go to the people who need them. Corrupt governments will be paralyzed by lobbyists, making sure the corporations are keeping their profits in check, meanwhile they'll go bankrupt trying to deal with millions of newly unemployed people. Without those jobs, people simply won't have enough money to keep the economy going. Crime will skyrocket as people go into desperation; taxes will barely be paid; police offices stripped away from the streets; and anarchy and lawlessness takes over Society. The relative value of human labor plummets, meaning almost everybody shut out of the economy without anything to keep themselves afloat apart from stealing from one another, fending for themselves and scrounging whatever they can to survive, which is an absolute recipe for chaos. People won't have anything to gain, so they won't have anything to lose; they'll vote for whoever says they'll make things better – the people offering the simplest solutions. It means a rise in extremism that will lead to unrest and eventually revolutions and even dictatorship and fascism, or if it swings the other way around, communism. Now it might seem like that's far away, but all it takes is enough hungry people to upend the entire system. Suddenly, the reality, the social norms that we live in today, just won't be able to exist. Key government services like policing, ambulances, law and order will just be abstract concepts that have no relevancy, and eventually the economic scales will tip back the other way, just like they always have, but it would take decades, and it's impossible to say how many casualties there will be along the way. And of course, none of this is set in stone. There is an alternative to this global tragedy, but it's all going to hinge on what happens to the money and the value that AI is going to create. If it gets to the people who need it, it will soften the blow significantly. There aren't any easy solutions, but there's a few things that could really help take the edge off this crisis. One solution that's been discussed, although not nearly enough, could be Universal Basic Income, otherwise known as UBI. Using the profits from AI and incredibly well-maintained automated systems, which are projected to make trillions in profits, developed governments could simply give their citizens enough money to never have to worry about working, but also keep Society in check and taxes paid. However, it's not just as simple as this. The loss of meaning in people's lives, as they have no passion, no actual work to do, no career, no destiny, will make people feel apathetic and just lazy. An essential part of being a human is working towards something, which can't just be replaced by a monthly check handed out by the government. It'd be more like a Band-Aid than an actual cure, but it would at least make sure that people don't go hungry and AI wouldn't completely destroy their lives.\u001b[00m\n\n\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:00][✅ AGENT 'RESEARCH AND TRANSCRIPT GENERATOR' COMPLETED TASK]: 2025-03-16 22:00:00.121102\u001b[00m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:00][✅ TASK COMPLETED: SEARCH YOUTUBE FOR VIDEOS ON 'AI TAKING OVER JOBS' AND RETURN THE TRANSCRIPT. HERE’S THE PRE-FETCHED TRANSCRIPT: AI AND AUTOMATION HAVE ARRIVED AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRANSFORM SOCIETY FOREVER FROM CASHIERS TO CEOS MORE JOBS ARE GETTING REPLACED BY THE MACHINES EVERY DAY THE RISE OF NEW AI MODELS IS PUT ON THE ACCELERATOR PLACING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF JOBS AT RISK BUT AS THE WORLD BECOMES MORE ROBOTIC MORE TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED WHAT PLACE WILL THERE BE FOR HUMANS JUST HOW MANY OF US WILL LOSE OUR JOBS AND IF SO WHO WILL BUY ANYTHING HOW WILL THE ECONOMY EVEN WORK WELL TODAY IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HUMANITY IN THE NEW AGE AND HOW THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO FUNCTION IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY NOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR THAT SOME NEW THING THAT EVERYONE IS PREDICTING WILL COMPLETELY TAKE OVER THE FUTURE MOST OF THEM GET OVERHYPED AND THEY END UP VISITING OUT OR IT TAKES DECADES TO SEE ANY REAL CHANGES AI AND AUTOMATION ARE DIFFERENT AS WE'LL SEE THEY'RE ALREADY CHANGING SOCIETY IN A MASSIVE WAY THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING TONS OF DIFFERENT JOBS AND INDUSTRIES ARE EITHER ABOUT TO CHANGE FOREVER OR THEY ALREADY HAVE WE MENTIONED CASHERS EARLIER AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE JOBS AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF AUTOMATION AND MOST CHANGED JOBS IN SUPER MARKETS IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND WE ALL SEE IT TODAY IT'S VERY RARE TO GO TO ANY STORE NOW WITHOUT ANY SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEM IT JUST SEEMS OUTDATED 2023 WAS ACTUALLY A RECORD YEAR FOR THESE MACHINES WITH OVER 200,000 NEW ONES ADDED TO THE SHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD AND THERE HAVE BEEN MIX FEELINGS ABOUT THEM EVER SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED BUT MOST PEOPLE AT LEAST TOLERATE THEM IN A 2021 SURVEY 60% OF PEOPLE SAID THEY PREFER THEM TO THE REGULAR CHECKOUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE FASTER THAN OTHER METHODS MORE EFFICIENT AND IF YOU IN YOUR OWN HEAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE EVEN IF ALL OF THIS IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OVER AN INCREDIBLY SLOW SYSTEM PEOPLE DO PREFER IT ESPECIALLY THE CORPORATIONS USING THEM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY SAVE IS ASTRONOMICAL WHAT USED TO TAKE PAYING 20 PEOPLE CAN NOW BE DONE WITH 20 MACHINES AND ONLY TWO EMPLOYEES TO OVERSEE THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY LOSE TONS OF STOCK TO THEFT WHICH IS VERY COMMON WITH THE MACHINES AS THEY STILL EASILY PAY FOR THEMSELVES OVER TIME IT ALSO DOESN'T MATTER IF THE WHOLE THING DOES END UP BEING A LOT MORE ANNOYING FOR THE CONSUMER THE PROCESS HASN'T BEEN FULLY AUTOMATED REALLY THE MACHINES ONLY TAKE SOME OF THE LOAD LEAVING THE REST OF IT UP TO YOU MEANING CORPORATIONS MAKE YOU DO THE WORK AND CUT OUT THE COST WHILE ALSO MAKING A PROFIT FROM IT AND THIS SMALL EXAMPLE IS A GLIMPSE INTO A FUTURE OF AUTOMATION ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE PROCESS GETTING AUTOMATED PEOPLE'S JOBS WILL GET REPLACED PARTLY BY MACHINES AND PARTLY BY PASSING THE WORK ONTO THE CONSUMERS INSTEAD IT'S SOMETHING YOU SEE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY OF JOBS THAT'S ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YEARS AND YEARS AGO IF YOU CALLED A COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE TALKING TO ANOTHER PERSON WHO COULD UNDERSTAND YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT NOW AUTOMATION IS MADE IT SO YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF MACHINES BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN IN THE QUEUE AND THAT'S IF THE BOT ON THE OTHER END CAN EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NER FOR EVERYONE AND IT CLEARLY DOESN'T MATTER IF THE SERVICE GETS BETTER AS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER IT MAKES A PROFIT AI MIGHT MAKE THESE PROBLEMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT IT WILL ALSO REPLACE LOTS OF THE THINGS THEY STILL NEED REAL PEOPLE FOR AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING TAKE THE INDIAN E-COMMERCE COMPANY DUAN WHICH WAS WORTH $70 MILLION IN THE LAST EVALUATION AND IN 2023 THEIR CEO TOOK TO TWITTER TO BRAG ABOUT HOW HE'D BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE 9 0% OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF WITH AN AI PROGRAM REDUCING THE COMPANY'S COST BY 85% YOU CAN FEEL THE JOY OOZING OUT OF HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE CAN FIRE 90% OF ONE OF HIS DEPARTMENTS WHILE OTHER CEOS MIGHT HIDE IT A BIT BETTER THEY'RE STILL SALIVATING OF THE POSSIBILITIES AS WELL THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH WILL SOON HAPPEN TO THE ENTIRE CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY EVENTUALLY EVEN REPRESENTATIVES AND PHYSICAL STORES COULD GET REPLACED BY A TOUCHSCREEN AND A CHAT BOT IT'S YET ANOTHER WHOLE CATEGORY OF JOBS THAT WILL SOON JUST DISAPPEAR UNDER THE STEAMROLLER OF AUTOMATION AND A I DATA ENTRY JOBS ARE GOING THE SAME WAY TOO BETWEEN 2014 AND 2022 THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WORKING THESE JOBS IN THE US FELL BY OVER 20% FROM 375,000 TO 295,000 IT'S ALREADY A DYING INDUSTRY ADVANCES IN AI WILL PUSH THIS OVER THE EDGE THE MORE PROCEDURAL AND CONSISTENT THE WORK IS THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT A COMPUTER CAN DO IT INSTEAD TO GO A BIT FURTHER ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER OFFICE JOBS ARE ALSO DESTINED TO BE REPLACED THIS CATEGORY ENCOMPASSES MILLIONS OF JOBS LOTS OF THEM COULD EASILY VANISH IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS SOME WILL SURVIVE OF COURSE IF YOU NEED SPECIALIST SKILLS OR YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IT'S MUCH HARDER TO AUTOMATE BUT THE ONES LOWER DOWN ON THE LADDER WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY GO WHICH WILL JUST MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET AN ENTRY-LEVEL JOB A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES IN IT CREATES MORE JOBS THAN IT REPLACES WHEN WE STARTED USING CARS INSTEAD OF HORSES FOR TRANSPORTATION IT DIDN'T UPEND THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THERE WERE NEW ROLES FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEFORE THAT BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH AI WILL THE SAME THING BE THE CASE WELL IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED WITH AI AND IT ISN'T A BLACK AND WHITE PCTURE PICTURE ONE

BIT OF EDITING BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IT'S FIT FOR PURPOSE JUST LIKE THE SELF CHECKER MACHINES IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF THE COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT ONE SKILL CODER COULD USE ADVANCED AI TO DO THE WORK OF FIVE OF 10 PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW TO THE FIELD IT MEANS THAT EVEN IF AI CAN'T DO 100% OF THE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB IT RAISES THE BAR EXPONENTIALLY AS TO WHAT THE STANDARD IS IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH CAN IN TURN REPLACE TONS OF PEOPLE A LOT OF THESE JOBS AREN'T THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY BE SPENDING THEIR WHOLE LIVES ON ANYWAY THOUGH BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE A CASHIER OR WORK IN DATA ENTRY WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP IN A 50 OR 100 YEARS TIME WHEN THE DUST IS SETTLED THE WORLD MAY ACTUALLY BE THANKFUL THAT WE'VE ESCAPED FROM ALL THIS MINIAL LABOR BUT UNTIL THAT POINT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERGO SOME HUGE CHANGES AND THE MAIN QUESTION WILL BE WHO WILL BE BUYING ANYTHING IF NOBODY'S REALLY WORKING ANYMORE AS WE MAY VERY WELL BE IN A WORLD WHERE NOT EVERYONE IS EXPECTED OR NEEDED TO EVEN HAVE A JOB SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM TO GO AROUND SO WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PREDICTIONS FOR HOW BAD THE DAMAGE IS REALLY GOING TO BE WELL THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES BUT EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE STILL MEAN THAT MILLIONS OF JOBS WILL GET REPLACED IN THE SHORT TERM IT ISN'T LOOKING GOOD IT'S GENERALLY AGREED THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF JOBS WILL BE LOST OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO AI A LOT MORE WILL BE IMPACTED IN SOME WAY WHICH MEANS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD WORK WILL GET AUTOMATED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE JOBS IT MEANS EMPLOYEES WOULD ONLY DEAL WITH THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS THAT AN AI CAN'T SOLVE EVEN THOUGH MOST PREDICTIONS THINK IT WILL BOOST THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE REPLACED THEN HOW WILL THE ECONOMY GO UP SO MUCH IF NO ONE CAN BUY ANYTHING WELL THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING AS WE'VE SEEN ALREADY WITH AUTOMATION WHEN THE JOB GETS EASIER THERE'S FAR MORE COMPETITION BEFORE GPS WAS WIDELY USED BEING A LONDON TAXI DRIVER WAS AN INCREDIBLY HARD JOB IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT YOU NEEDED TO MEMOR A COMPLETE STREET MAP OF THE CITY GPS AND RIDE SHARING APPS TORE THROUGH THIS BARRIER MEANING ANYONE WITH A CAR AND A PHONE COULD ADEQUATELY DO THE JOB AND THE RESULTS WERE CLEAR LONDON TAXI DRIVERS SAW THEIR WAGES FALL BY 10% AND IT SEEMS LIKE AI MIGHT DO THIS EXACT SAME THING TO NEARLY EVERY JOB THERE IS 60% OF THEM IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE PARTS THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED WILL BE TAKEN OVER LEAVING EITHER LESS JOBS OR LOWER WAGES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN STILL CLING ON THE PAPERWORK THAT MAKES UP TONS OF THE WORKLOAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE DOCTORS OR POLICE OFFICERS WILL DISAPPEAR MEANING THERE'S LESS WORK OVERALL ONLY A FEW INDUSTRIES LIKE TEACHING OR AGRICULTURE ARE GOING TO ESCAPE SOME LEVEL OF AUTOMATION WHICH AGAIN BRINGS UP THE SAME MASSIVE QUESTION HOW WILL THE ECONOMY THEN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WITH SO MANY PEOPLE EITHER OUT OF WORK OR STRUGGLING TO MAKE END ME IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD HAVE BEEN TAKING RECORD PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE AND SO IT DOESN'T SEEM REALISTIC TO IMAGINE THAT THEY'RE SUDDENLY GOING TO SHARE THE MONEY THEY'LL MAKE FROM THE AI REVOLUTION IT'S CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY WORK PHYSICAL LABOR WILL STILL BE IMPORTANT BUT IT WON'T BE IS COMMON BASIC OFFICE WORK AND SIMPLE COGNITIVE TASKS ARE GOING TO BE FAR LESS IMPORTANT IT'S WHAT AI DOES BEST MEANWHILE COMPLICATED TASKS WHICH NEED A LOT OF TRAINING OR A GOOD DEAL OF NATURAL ABILITY WILL BE IN MUCH HIGHER DEMAND WE'VE SEEN FROM HISTORY THAT THESE KINDS OF SHIFTS LEAD TO STAGNANT WAGES AFTER THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN THE 19TH CENTURY WHEN MILLIONS MOVED FROM AGRICULTURE TO MANUFACTURING WAGES STAYED AT AROUND THE SAME LEVEL FOR 50 YEARS STRAIGHT IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN THEN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP WE SEE TODAY COULD CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 30 TO 40 YEARS BEFORE IT CORRECTS ITSELF IN FACT THIS TIME IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORSE IT'S A SIMPLE TRUTH THAT TONS OF PEOPLE JUST AREN'T ACADEMICALLY SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TRANSITION IT'S A PIPE DREAM TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN THE MILLIONS OF TRUCK DRIVERS THAT WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS TO DO SOMETHING ELSE THE JOBS THEY COULD REALISTICALLY WORK INSTEAD ARE DISAPPEARING PEOPLE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS CAN'T REALLY EASILY RETRAIN IN ANOTHER FIELD AND OFTEN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BEST OF CASES THEY GO INTO DISABILITY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES OFTEN THEY JUST CAN'T COPE WITH LOSING THEIR PURPOSE TURNING TO DRINK OR DRUGS OR SIMPLY JUST GIVING UP IT'S AWFUL TRAGEDY THAT'S GOING TO BE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF WE CAN'T FIND A SOLUTION AND THIS TRANSITION WILL LEAVE TONS OF PEOPLE BEHIND AS MOST OF US JUST DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS OR THE NATURAL ABILITY TO WORK THE HIGHLY COMPLICATED ACADEMIC JOBS THAT AI WILL CREATE THE AI TRUCKS WILL NEED PEOPLE TO OVERSEE THE OPERATION AND MAKE SURE IT'S ALL RUNNING SMOOTHLY EVEN DIRECTLY TAKING CONTROL OF CERTAIN TRUCKS IF NECESSARY BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE EASY FOR ANYONE TO PICK UP WITHOUT SPECIFIC TRAINING THE WORLD IS JUST GETTING TOO COMPLICATED FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT THIS COULD BE ONE AREA WHERE PEOPLE COULD STILL FIND A NICHE INSTEAD INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY WORKING AS A CASHIER SHOP ASSISTANTS NOW OFTEN OVERSEE A GROUP OF SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES INSTEAD OF THE JOB GETTING HARDER IT CHANGED THAT MOST OF THE WORK IS GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS INSTEAD AS MORE AND MORE OF THE WORLD GETS AUTOMATED WE'LL NEED TONS OF PEOPLE TO START WORKING THESE JOBS IN OTHER FIELDS GRANDMA IS NOT GOING TO BE MAGICALLY FIGURING ALL OF THIS OUT HERSELF SHE'S GOING TO NEED SOME HELP BECAUSE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES ARE MOSTLY MADE UP OF SERVICE JOBS THIS IS GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S A NICHE THAT PEOPLE WITH MORE HUMAN- CENTERED SKILLS ARE GOING TO THRIVE IN AND IT COULD BE A GOOD WAY TO TRANSITION PEOPLE THAT AREN'T GOING TO RETRAIN AS CODERS OR COMPLEX SYSTEM MANAGERS THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVEN IF ENOUGH OF THESE JOBS GET CREATED WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY THEY OFTEN PAY WAY LESS IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO SEE WAY LESS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF NORMAL PEOPLE IN GENERAL BUT AGAIN THEN HOW WILL THE ECONOMY CONTINUE TO FUNCTION HOW CAN PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP AND AN ECONOMY START BOOMING IF NOBODY HAS ANY MONEY TO ACTUALLY SPEND WE'RE AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO MAIN WAYS THIS CAN ALL PLAY OUT THE FIRST OPTION COULD JUST BE COMPLETE DISASTER SOCIETY CONTINUES ON NO CHECKS ARE IN PLACE BIG TECH AI COMPANIES GET OUT OF CONTROL ETHICS DEPARTMENTS ARE CONTINUALLY STRIPPED AND LACKING GOVERNMENT REGULATION MEANS WE ENTER INTO A TECHNOCRACY COMPANIES WILL PRETEND IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT OVER TIME THEY'LL CUT OUT MORE AND MORE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOMEONE TO DEAL WITH LATER ON IF USING AI MAKES A COMPANY 20% MORE PRODUCTIVE THEN THEY CAN FIRE 20% OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MAINTAIN THE SAME OUTPUTS PEOPLE WON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S AI EITHER THEY'LL JUST GET FIRED FOR QUOTE UNDERPERFORMING INSTEAD ON THIS PATH WE'LL SEE AN OUTCRY OF BIG CHANGES LIKE SELF-DRIVING TRUCKS BUT THE SMALL CHANGES THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER WILL GO UNNOTICED THE MEDIA WILL BLAME THE SAME TD OLD ISSUES WHILE MORE PEOPLE GET PUSHED OUT OF THE SYSTEM EVERY DAY IN THIS FUTURE THE PROFITS FROM AI WON'T GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS WILL BE PARALYZED BY LOBBYISTS MAKING SURE THE CORPORATIONS ARE KEEPING THEIR PROFITS IN CHECK MEANWHILE THEY'LL GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO DEAL WITH MILLIONS OF NEWLY UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WITHOUT THOSE JOBS PEOPLE SIMPLY WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING CRIME WILL SKYROCKET AS PEOPLE GO INTO DESPERATION TAXES WILL BARELY BE PAID POLICE OFFICE IS STRIPPED AWAY FROM THE STREETS AND ANARCHY AND LAWLESSNESS TAKES OVER SOCIETY THE RELATIVE VALUE OF HUMAN LABOR PLUMMETS MEANING ALMOST EVERYBODY SHUT OUT OF THE ECONOMY WITHOUT ANYTHING TO KEEP THEMSELVES AFLOAT APART FROM STEALING FROM ONE ANOTHER FENDING FOR THEMSELVES AND SING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SURVIVE WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE RECIPE FOR CHAOS PEOPLE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO GAIN SO THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE THEY'LL VOTE FOR WHOEVER SAYS THEY'LL MAKE THINGS BETTER THE PEOPLE OFFERING THE SIMPLEST SOLUTIONS IT MEANS A RISE IN EXTREMISM THAT WILL LEAD TO UNREST AND EVENTUALLY REVOLUTIONS AND EVEN DICTATORSHIP AND FASCISM OR IF IT'S WINGS THE OTHER WAY AROUND COMMUNISM NOW IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THAT'S FAR AWAY BUT ALL IT TAKES IS ENOUGH HUNGRY PEOPLE TO UPEND THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SUDDENLY THE REALITY THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO EXIST KEY GOVERNMENT SERVICES LIKE POLICING AMBULANCES LAW AND ORDER WILL JUST BE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT HAVE NO RELEVANCY AND EVENTUALLY THE ECONOMIC SCALES WILL TI BACK THE OTHER WAY JUST LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE BUT IT WOULD TAKE DECADES AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW MANY CASUALTIES THERE WILL BE ALONG THE WAY AND OF COURSE NONE OF THIS IS SET IN STONE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS GLOBAL TRAGEDY BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO HINGE ON WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY AND THE VALUE THAT AI IS GOING TO CREATE IF IT GETS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT IT WILL SOFTEN THE BLOW SIGNIFICANTLY THERE AREN'T ANY EASY SOLUTIONS BUT THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT COULD REALLY HELP TAKE THE EDGE OF THIS CRISIS ONE SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALTHOUGH NOT NEARLY ENOUGH COULD BE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OTHERWISE KNOWN AS UBI USING THE PROFITS FROM AI AND INCREDIBLY WELL-MAINTAINED AUTOMATED SYSTEMS WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO MAKE TRILLIONS IN PROFITS DEVELOPED GOVERNMENTS COULD SIMPLY GIVE THEIR CITIZENS ENOUGH MONEY TO NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WORKING BUT ALSO KEEP SOCIETY IN CHECK AND TAX IS PAID HOWEVER IT'S NOT JUST AS SIMPLE AS THIS THE LOSS OF MEANING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IS THEY HAVE NO PASSION NO ACTUAL WORK TO DO NO CAREER NO DESTINY WILL MAY PEOPLE FEEL APATHETIC AND JUST LAZY AN ESSENTIAL PART OF BEING A HUMAN IS WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING WHICH CAN'T JUST BE REPLACED BY A MONTHLY CHECK HANDED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT IT'D BE MORE LIKE A BAND-AID THAN AN ACTUAL CURE BUT IT WOULD AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO HUNGRY AND AI WOULDN'T COMPLETELY DESTROY THEIR LIVES]: 2025-03-16

of jobs across various sectors.  From cashiers and customer service representatives to data entry clerks and office administrators, roles involving repetitive or procedural tasks are highly vulnerable. While some predict AI will boost the global economy, the displacement of human labor raises concerns about widespread unemployment and economic instability.  The potential for lower wages and increased competition is significant, particularly impacting those without advanced skills or college degrees.  Solutions like Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been proposed to mitigate the negative consequences, but the issue of maintaining purpose and motivation in a largely automated society remains a challenge. The future hinges on how the profits generated by AI are distributed and whether governments can implement effective measures to prevent widespread economic hardship and social unrest.\u001b[00m\n\n\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:01][✅ AGENT 'CONTENT SUMMARIZER' COMPLETED TASK]: 2025-03-16 22:00:01.780125\u001b[00m\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\u001b[92m22:00:03 - LiteLLM:INFO\u001b[0m: utils.py:2896 - \nLiteLLM completion() model= gemini-1.5-flash; provider = gemini\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:03][✅ TASK COMPLETED: GENERATE A 100-150 WORD SUMMARY OF THE TRANSCRIPT]: 2025-03-16 22:00:03.393550\u001b[00m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:03][📋 TASK STARTED: CREATE A LINKEDIN POST (200-300 CHARACTERS) BASED ON THE TRANSCRIPT]: 2025-03-16 22:00:03.405364\u001b[00m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:03][🤖 AGENT 'LINKEDIN POST CREATOR' STARTED TASK]: 2025-03-16 22:00:03.407041\u001b[00m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[95m# Agent:\u001b[00m \u001b[1m\u001b[92mLinkedIn Post Creator\u001b[00m\n\u001b[95m## Task:\u001b[00m \u001b[92mCreate a LinkedIn post (200-300 characters) based on the transcript\u001b[00m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:03][🤖 LLM CALL STARTED]: 2025-03-16 22:00:03.407521\u001b[00m\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\u001b[92m22:00:04 - LiteLLM:INFO\u001b[0m: utils.py:1084 - Wrapper: Completed Call, calling success_handler\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[1m\u001b[94m \n[2025-03-16 22:00:04][✅ LLM CALL COMPLETED]: 2025-03-16 22:00:04.416896\u001b[00m\n\n\n\u001b[1m\u001b[95m# Agent:\u001b[00m \u001b[1m\u001b[92mLinkedIn Post Creator\u001b[00m\n\u001b[95m## Final Answer:\u001b[00m \u001b[92m\nAI is transforming the job market, impacting millions.

From cashiers to CEOs, more jobs are getting replaced by the machines every day. The rise of new AI models is put on the accelerator, placing hundreds of millions of jobs at risk. But as the world becomes more robotic, more technology focused, what place will there be for humans? Just how many of us will lose our jobs? And if so, who will buy anything? How will the economy even work? Well, today in this video we're going to find out what's going to happen to humanity in the new age and how the economy is going to function in a completely different way. Now it seems like every year that some new thing that everyone is predicting will completely take over the future. Most of them get overhyped and they end up fizzling out, or it takes decades to see any real changes. AI and automation are different, as we'll see. They're already changing Society in a massive way. This is just the beginning. Tons of different jobs and industries are either about to change forever or they already have. We mentioned cashiers earlier, and they're one of the jobs at the highest risk of automation and most changed jobs in supermarkets. It's already happened and we all see it today. It's very rare to go to any store now without any self-checkout machines, and if they don't have them it just seems outdated. 2023 was actually a record year for these machines, with over 200,000 new ones added to the shops across the world. And there have been mixed feelings about them ever since they were introduced, but most people at least tolerate them. In a 2021 survey, 60% of people said they prefer them to the regular checkout most of the time. They're faster than other methods, more efficient, and if you're in your own head, you don't have to speak to anyone. Even if all of this is just a minor improvement over an incredibly slow system, people do prefer it, especially the corporations using them. The amount of money they save is astronomical. What used to take paying 20 people can now be done with 20 machines and only two employees to oversee them. It doesn't matter if they lose tons of stock to theft, which is very common with the machines, as they still easily pay for themselves over time. It also doesn't matter if the whole thing does end up being a lot more annoying for the consumer. The process hasn't been fully automated, really. The machines only take some of the load, leaving the rest of it up to you, meaning corporations make you do the work and cut out the cost while also making a profit from it. And this small example is a glimpse into a future of automation on a much larger scale. Instead of the whole process getting automated, people's jobs will get replaced partly by machines and partly by passing the work onto the consumers instead. It's something you see in another category of jobs that's about to disappear: customer service. Years and years ago, if you called a company's customer service line, you would immediately be talking to another person who could understand your very specific question. But now automation has made it so you need to go through five different layers of machines before you're even in the queue, and that's if the bot on the other end can even understand what you're saying. It's an absolute nightmare for everyone, and it clearly doesn't matter if the service gets better, as the only thing that matters is whether it makes a profit. AI might make these problems a little bit better, but it will also replace lots of the things they still need real people for, and it's already happening. Take the Indian e-commerce company, Dukaan, which was worth $70 million in the last evaluation, and in 2023 their CEO took to Twitter to brag about how he'd been able to replace 90% of the customer service staff with an AI program, reducing the company's cost by 85%. You can feel the joy oozing out of his announcement that he can fire 90% of one of his departments. While other CEOs might hide it a bit better, they're still salivating at the possibilities as well. This is something which will soon happen to the entire customer service industry. Eventually, even representatives in physical stores could get replaced by a touchscreen and a chatbot. It's yet another whole category of jobs that will soon just disappear under the steamroller of automation and AI. Data entry jobs are going the same way, too. Between 2014 and 2022, the amount of people working these jobs in the US fell by over 20%, from 375,000 to 295,000. It's already a dying industry. Advances in AI will push this over the edge. The more procedural and consistent the work is, the more likely it is that a computer can do it instead. To go a bit further, administration and other office jobs are also destined to be replaced. This category encompasses millions of jobs; lots of them could easily vanish in the next 10 years. Some will survive, of course. If you need specialist skills or you need to deal with lots of different problems, it's much harder to automate, but the ones lower down on the ladder will almost certainly go, which will just make it harder for young people to get an entry-level job. A lot of the time when new technology comes in, it creates more jobs than it replaces. When we started using cars instead of horses for transportation, it didn't upend the economy because there were new roles for people to take. It was the same with the Industrial Revolution before that. But what will happen with AI? Will the same thing be the case? Well, it's a lot more complicated with AI, and it isn't a black and white picture.

Using my link now, we've seen how new generative AI models like ChatGPT are almost perfectly suited to basic coding. Get them a single prompt and they'll do hours of work within seconds. With a bit of editing by someone who knows what they're doing, it's fit for purpose. Just like the self-checkout machines, it isn't a question of the complete replacement of people. It's just that one skilled coder could use advanced AI to do the work of five or 10 people who are new to the field. It means that even if AI can't do 100% of the tasks associated with the job, it raises the bar exponentially as to what the standard is in the industry, which can in turn replace tons of people. A lot of these jobs aren't things people should really be spending their whole lives on anyway, though, because nobody really wants to be a cashier or work in data entry when they're growing up. In 50 or 100 years' time, when the dust is settled, the world may actually be thankful that we've escaped from all this menial labor. But until that point, the economy is going to have to undergo some huge changes, and the main question will be: who will be buying anything if nobody's really working anymore? As we may very well be in a world where not everyone is expected or needed to even have a job, simply because there just aren't enough of them to go around. So what are the various predictions for how bad the damage is really going to be? Well, there's lots of different estimates, but even the most conservative still mean that millions of jobs will get replaced in the short term. It isn't looking good. It's generally agreed that tens of millions of jobs will be lost over the next decade to AI. A lot more will be impacted in some way, which means that some parts of the world's work will get automated. For customer service jobs, it means employees would only deal with the complicated problems that an AI can't solve. Even though most predictions think it will boost the global economy by trillions of dollars, so how does this make sense? If people are actually going to be replaced, then how will the economy go up so much if no one can buy anything? Well, this is where it gets interesting. As we've seen already with automation, when the job gets easier, there's far more competition. Before GPS was widely used, being a London taxi driver was an incredibly hard job. If you wanted to do it, you needed to memorize a complete street map of the city. GPS and ride-sharing apps tore through this barrier, meaning anyone with a car and a phone could adequately do the job, and the results were clear. London taxi drivers saw their wages fall by 10%, and it seems like AI might do this exact same thing to nearly every job there is – 60% of them in developed countries. The parts that can be automated will be taken over, leaving either less jobs or lower wages for the people who can still cling on. The paperwork that makes up tons of the workload for people like doctors or police officers will disappear, meaning there's less work overall. Only a few industries like teaching or agriculture are going to escape some level of automation, which again brings up the same massive question: how will the economy then continue to function with so many people either out of work or struggling to make ends meet? It isn't clear how we're going to solve this. Corporations across the board have been taking record profits at the expense of almost everyone else, and so it doesn't seem realistic to imagine that they're suddenly going to share the money they'll make from the AI revolution. It's clear at this point that people are going to need to change the way they work. Physical labor will still be important, but it won't be as common. Basic office work and simple cognitive tasks are going to be far less important; it's what AI does best. Meanwhile, complicated tasks which need a lot of training or a good deal of natural ability will be in much higher demand. We've seen from history that these kinds of shifts lead to stagnant wages. After the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, when millions moved from agriculture to manufacturing, wages stayed at around the same level for 50 years straight. If this happens again, then the economic hardship we see today could continue for another 30 to 40 years before it corrects itself. In fact, this time it might even be worse. It's a simple truth that tons of people just aren't academically smart enough to make the transition. It's a pipe dream to imagine that we're going to train the millions of truck drivers that will lose their jobs to do something else. The jobs they could realistically work instead are disappearing. People without college degrees that lose their jobs can't really easily retrain in another field and often fall through the cracks. In the best of cases, they go into disability for the rest of their lives. Often they just can't cope with losing their purpose, turning to drink or drugs, or simply just giving up. It's an awful tragedy that's going to be repeated over and over again if we can't find a solution. And this transition will leave tons of people behind, as most of us just don't have the skills or the natural ability to work the highly complicated, academic jobs that AI will create. The AI trucks will need people to oversee the operation and make sure it's all running smoothly, even directly taking control of certain trucks if necessary, but it's not something that's going to be easy for anyone to pick up without specific training. The world is just getting too complicated for most people. But this could be one area where people could still find a niche. Instead of directly working as a cashier, shop assistants now often oversee a group of self-checkout machines. Instead of the job getting harder, it changed; most of the work is guiding people through the process instead. As more and more of the world gets automated, we'll need tons of people to start working these jobs in other fields. Grandma is not going to be magically figuring all of this out herself; she's going to need some help. Because developed economies are mostly made up of service jobs, this is going to create more jobs than you might think. It's a niche that people with more human-centered skills are going to thrive in, and it could be a good way to transition people that aren't going to retrain as coders or complex system managers. The problem is that even if enough of these jobs get created, which seems unlikely, they often pay way less. In fact, we're going to see way less money in the hands of normal people in general. But again, then how will the economy continue to function? How can prices continue to go up and an economy start booming if nobody has any money to actually spend? We're at a crossroads right now. There are two main ways this can all play out. The first option could just be complete disaster. Society continues on; no checks are in place. Big tech, AI companies get out of control; ethics departments are continually stripped and lacking. Government regulation means we enter into a technocracy. Companies will pretend it's business as usual, but over time they'll cut out more and more of their employees, leaving the consequences for someone to deal with later on. If using AI makes a company 20% more productive, then they can fire 20% of their employees and maintain the same outputs. People won't even know it's AI; they'll just get fired for \"underperforming\" instead. On this path, we'll see an outcry of big changes like self-driving trucks, but the small changes that make the difference when you put them together will go unnoticed. The media will blame the same old issues while more people get pushed out of the system every day. In this future, the profits from AI won't go to the people who need them. Corrupt governments will be paralyzed by lobbyists, making sure the corporations are keeping their profits in check, meanwhile they'll go bankrupt trying to deal with millions of newly unemployed people. Without those jobs, people simply won't have enough money to keep the economy going. Crime will skyrocket as people go into desperation; taxes will barely be paid; police offices stripped away from the streets; and anarchy and lawlessness takes over Society. The relative value of human labor plummets, meaning almost everybody shut out of the economy without anything to keep themselves afloat apart from stealing from one another, fending for themselves and scrounging whatever they can to survive, which is an absolute recipe for chaos. People won't have anything to gain, so they won't have anything to lose; they'll vote for whoever says they'll make things better – the people offering the simplest solutions. It means a rise in extremism that will lead to unrest and eventually revolutions and even dictatorship and fascism, or if it swings the other way around, communism. Now it might seem like that's far away, but all it takes is enough hungry people to upend the entire system. Suddenly, the reality, the social norms that we live in today, just won't be able to exist. Key government services like policing, ambulances, law and order will just be abstract concepts that have no relevancy, and eventually the economic scales will tip back the other way, just like they always have, but it would take decades, and it's impossible to say how many casualties there will be along the way. And of course, none of this is set in stone. There is an alternative to this global tragedy, but it's all going to hinge on what happens to the money and the value that AI is going to create. If it gets to the people who need it, it will soften the blow significantly. There aren't any easy solutions, but there's a few things that could really help take the edge off this crisis. One solution that's been discussed, although not nearly enough, could be Universal Basic Income, otherwise known as UBI. Using the profits from AI and incredibly well-maintained automated systems, which are projected to make trillions in profits, developed governments could simply give their citizens enough money to never have to worry about working, but also keep Society in check and taxes paid. However, it's not just as simple as this. The loss of meaning in people's lives, as they have no passion, no actual work to do, no career, no destiny, will make people feel apathetic and just lazy. An essential part of being a human is working towards something, which can't just be replaced by a monthly check handed out by the government. It'd be more like a Band-Aid than an actual cure, but it would at least make sure that people don't go hungry and AI wouldn't completely destroy their lives.\n\nSummary:\nThe rise of AI and automation is rapidly transforming society, threatening millions of jobs across various sectors.  From cashiers and customer service representatives to data entry clerks and office administrators, roles involving repetitive or procedural tasks are highly vulnerable. While some predict AI will boost the global economy, the displacement of human labor raises concerns about widespread unemployment and economic instability.  The potential for lower wages and increased competition is significant, particularly impacting those without advanced skills or college degrees.  Solutions like Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been proposed to mitigate the negative consequences, but the issue of maintaining purpose and motivation in a largely automated society remains a challenge. The future hinges on how the profits generated by AI are distributed and whether governments can implement effective measures to prevent widespread economic hardship and social unrest.\n\nLinkedIn Post:\nAI is transforming the job market, impacting millions.
